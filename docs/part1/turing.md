## Turing-recognisable and decidable languages

A language is said to be __Turing-recognisable__ or __recursively enumerable__, just if it is recognised by some Turing machine.

A language is said to be __co-Turing-recognisible__ or __corecursively enumerable__, just if its complement is recognised by some Turing machine.

A language is said to be __Turing-decidable__ or __recursive__, just if it is decided by some Turing machine.
