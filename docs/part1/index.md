## Materials
This site contains all the definitions and theorems that you need to be able to do the problem sheets and exam for the "Computation" part of Programming Languages and Computation.  

The textbook [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/bristol/detail.action?docID=5133051) by Michael Sipser is the ultimate reference for the computability theory in this part of the unit, but I have collected the formal material into this site because:
* Not everyone has a paper copy of the book and the electronic version (which everyone has access to via the library catalogue) is not easy to navigate.
* I want to talk about (and therefore display) the definitions and theorems during lectures.
* The Sipser book does not cover the logic part especially well.

You will need to refer to the textbook or take notes during lectures for discussion of examples, motivation etc.
