# Part II: Programming Languages
This page contains all the information specific to Part II.
1. TOC

## Schedule

This part will cover the semantics of programming languages in theory and in practice.
* We start by introducing the untyped lambda calculus as an alternative model of computation, exploring its (simple) abstract syntax, and defining and implementing some of its (very simple) semantics.
* We will then look towards a much more earthly imperative language—IMP—and its semantics, which we'll animate as they are, and perhaps extend.
* We will think about the logical and mathematical tools we need to reason about a language's semantics, and a program's correctness.
* We will define and animate the semantics of a small stack machine, and define a translation from IMP to its language. We will implement this translation as a compiler.
